# The Complete Self Driving Car Course
### Deep Learning and Computer Vision applied to self-driving cars


My walkthrough of the course ["The Complete Self Driving Car Course"](https://www.udemy.com/course/applied-deep-learningtm-the-complete-self-driving-car-course/) on Udemy


## 01 - Lane Detection
  Detecting lanes in images and videos with OpenCV, using Hough Transform.
  [Read-only Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chamatt/The-Complete-Self-Driving-Car-Course/blob/master/01%20-%20Lane%20Detection/Lane%20Detection.ipynb)
  
## 02 - Intro to Neural Networks
A simple linear binary classification neural network, with one perceptron, build using numpy.

## 03 - Keras
A simple linear binary classification neural network, now using **tf.keras**
[Read-only Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chamatt/The-Complete-Self-Driving-Car-Course/blob/master/03%20-%20Keras/Keras.ipynb)

## 04 - Deep Neural Networks
Non-linear classification with Deep Neural Networks
[Read-only Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chamatt/The-Complete-Self-Driving-Car-Course/blob/master/04%20-%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks/Deep%20Neural%20Network.ipynb)

## 05 - Multiclass Classification
Multiclass classification (learning about One Hot Encoding, ReLu and SoftMax activation function)
[Read-only Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chamatt/The-Complete-Self-Driving-Car-Course/blob/master/05%20-%20Multiclass%20Classification/Multiclass.ipynb)

## 06 - MNIST Image Recognition
Trying to do Digit classification using MNIST Dataset, on a traditional Deep Neural Networks, and finding out it's flaws on image classification. (Includes an interactible canvas for drawing and testing the predictions)
[Read-only Notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/chamatt/The-Complete-Self-Driving-Car-Course/blob/master/06%20-%20MNIST%20Image%20Recognition/MNIST.ipynb)

## 07 - Convolutional Neural Networks
Again using the MNIST Dataset, but with a Convolutional Neural Network, that uses LeNet Architeture consisting of the following layers:
1.   Input Layer 
2.   Conv2D (30 layers, 5x5 kernels, relu activation function)
3.   Pooling layer (Max of 2x2 window)
4.   Conv2D (15 layers, 3x3 kernels, relu activation function)
5.   Pooling layer (Max of 2x2 window)
6.   Dense Fully Connected Layer (500 perceptrons, relu activation function)
7.   Output Layer (10 categories, softmax)
